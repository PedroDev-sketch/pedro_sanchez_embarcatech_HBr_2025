## Project Description

This is a rather simple project, focused on turning on the lights of the BitDogLab, the main purpose, however, is to explore the modular architecture project organization, by separating the different functions of the code in separate layers, such as:
Direct Hardware Control, Abstraction Layer focused on simple and reusable functionalities, Main Applicated Logic and many more.
